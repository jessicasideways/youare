The You Are Theme
=================
The You Are Theme is a very personal, minimalistic theme for WordPress. It is based off of the YouAre theme created by the former social network, YouAre.com.


Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
### What license will the You Are Theme be issued under?
Due to the fact that the original YouAre Theme was issued under the GPU license, I do not think that the You Are Theme can break from that tradition. Before the first stable release, though, I will try to figure out if this is really the case.

### When will the You Are Theme be publicly available for download?
Sometime in mid-July 2013.

YouAre Theme Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------
Note: These instructions were not written by me, but by the creator of the original theme. Please understand that as the theme is improved, these will be much simpler. Thanks for your understanding. ;)

Plugins required and recommended are in the zip files that you downloaded. Upload and activate plugins, before activating the theme itself. No template editing required. Just plugin activation :)
