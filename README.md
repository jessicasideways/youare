The You Are Theme
=================
The You Are Theme is a very personal, minimalistic theme for WordPress. It is currently compatible with WordPress 2.8, but efforts are underway to modernise the theme, making it easier to use, maintain and customise. It is based off of the YouAre theme created by the former social network, YouAre.com.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
### What license will the You Are Theme be issued under?
Due to the fact that the original YouAre Theme was issued under the [GNU Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), I do not think that the You Are Theme can break from that tradition. This is also what allows me to take the code structure, refactor it, improve upon it and develop a new theme from it - so you will not hear me complaining about it! Before the first stable release, though, I will try to figure out if this is really the case.

### When will the You Are Theme be publicly available for download?
It is currently available for download through [Github](https://github.com/jessicasideways/youare). It will be publicised on [the WordPress Themes Directory](http://wordpress.org/themes/) upon releasing the first stable version.

### Will the classic version of the YouAre Theme be available or updated?
The YouAre Theme will be refactored, recoded to emphasise Semantic Web practices, updated to HTML5 and will be upgraded to WordPress 3.7.1, but at this time, there are no plans to continue the YouAre Theme, instead focusing on the You Are Theme (currently, that is the name being used while the theme is in development). The YouAre theme and its revisions/updates will continue to historically be available through Github as they are committed. There will be some structural improvements and refactoring made so that the theme can be properly maintained, as well as documentation written. The documentation will be made available on the You Are Theme GitHub page as it is written and updated as the code is maintained.

### Will there be a live demo site?
As soon as the theme gets closer to being 3.7.1 compatible, yes there will be a dedicated demo site. Until that time, however, you can preview the progress of the theme at the developer's personal blog, [Not My Pony](http://notmypony.com/) where she has the You Are Theme installed and continually makes updates and improvements to the structure of the theme.

YouAre Theme Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------
Note: These instructions were not written by me, but by the creator of the original theme. Please understand that as the theme is improved, these will be much simpler (such as the plugins no longer being required). Thanks for your understanding. ;)

Plugins required and recommended are in the zip files that you downloaded. Upload and activate plugins, before activating the theme itself. No template editing required. Just plugin activation :)
