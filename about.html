		<h1>About the You Are Theme</h1>
		<p class="lead">The You Are Theme is a WordPress theme framework in development and is consistently evolving to meet the needs of people interested in a personal website.</p>
		
		<h2>You Are vs. YouAre</h2>
		<p>The You Are Theme is a continuation from the YouAre Theme. The YouAre Theme was a very simple WordPress theme that was good at what it was billed for: <strong>minimalism</strong>. The You Are Theme takes that idea and puts what is important to the site owner first. If you want <a href="classic.html">more information on the classic YouAre theme, it is available</a> but we are treating it as a legacy product more than anything else.</p>
