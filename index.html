				<h2>Roadmap</h2>
				<p>Currently, the goal is to get the original YouAre theme compatible with the latest version of WordPress, which is currently 3.7.1. Additionally, work is in progress to get it working with Bootstrap, make it plugin independent and after that, time to take this theme in a new direction. All of this work should be completed by end of November 2013.</p>
	  
	  			<h2>Multilingual</h2>
				<p>Currently, the You Are Theme is currently available only in English. However, You Are will eventually be available in French, German and Italian.</p>
